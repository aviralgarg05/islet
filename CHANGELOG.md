# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (30 September 2026)

First version. Islet puts live activities in the space around the MacBook notch and lets other apps and scripts put their own there.

### What's in it

- **Now Playing** for any app that reports to macOS, including browser tabs. It works on macOS 15.4 and later, where Apple locked the private API most notch apps relied on. A small helper runs inside `/usr/bin/perl`, and the Music and Spotify notifications back it up.
- **Live activities** with progress, steps, countdowns and count-ups, states, buttons and links. You can send them with the `isletctl` CLI, a local HTTP API (loopback only, token required), the `islet://` URL scheme, or xbar-style script widgets.
- **Coding agents.** Claude Code hooks and Codex `notify` show what the agent is doing, and flag when it's waiting for you.
- **Calls.** A timer appears when FaceTime, Zoom, Teams, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp or a browser call is using the microphone.
- **System events.** Volume and brightness HUD, charging, low battery, Low Power Mode, audio output changes, Focus (through a Shortcuts automation) and a summary on unlock.
- **Calendar.** Next event, a reminder five minutes before, and a Join button for Zoom, Meet, Teams and Webex links.
- **File shelf** with AirDrop, clipboard history (off by default, skips password managers), download progress and system stats.
- **Notification mirroring.** Experimental and opt-in; needs Accessibility.
- **iPhone Shortcuts bridge.** Off by default. The same API is served on the local network with a token and a rate limit.
- **Appearance.** Compact, Standard and Large sizes; Black, Graphite and Glass themes; five motion styles including Off; up to three activities at once; per-app rules.

### Measured on an M3 Pro MacBook Pro, macOS 27.0.1

From `scripts/perf.sh` (8-second windows) and `Tests/E2E/e2e.py`:

| State | CPU |
|---|---|
| Idle | 0.0% |
| Music playing, closed island | 0.0% |
| Live countdown | 0.62% |
| Island open with Now Playing | 0.25% |

Memory stayed between 73 and 88 MB across those runs. 132 unit and system tests and 51 end-to-end checks pass.

### Known issues

- When something is showing in the closed island, its sides can cover menu bar icons that sit close to the notch. Fixed in the next version.
- Notification mirroring depends on Notification Center's accessibility tree and hasn't been tested against every app.
- Apple Intelligence features only switch on when the on-device model is downloaded. Otherwise Islet falls back to its own icon rules.
- The build is ad-hoc signed, so macOS will ask you to confirm the first launch.
